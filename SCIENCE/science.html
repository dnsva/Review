      <h2>Volcanoes & Earthquakes</h2>
      <p>
        <h4>Volcanoes</h4>
        - Magma - underneath the surface <p>
        - Lava - above
        <h4>Earthquakes</h4>
        - Epicenter - the point on the Earth's suface directly ABOVE THE FOCUS <br>
        - Focus - middle
        </p>
      </p>

      <h2>Ecosystems</h2> 
      <p>
        <h3>Terms</h3>
        <u>Individual</u> - a single organism <br>
        <u>Population</u> - multiple of the same species <br>
        <u>Community</u> - multiple populations of diff species living together <br>
        <u>Ecosystem</u> - the community interacting with each other & with abiotic factors <br>
        <u>Sustainability</u> - when an ecosystem can keep natural processes going consistently without interruption or help <br>
        <u>Articifical Ecosystem</u> - zoos, aquariums, etc. 
        
        <h3>Sun's Energy</h3> 
        - 30% reflected back <br>
        - 19% absorbed by atmosphere <br>
        - 51% absorbed by ground and ocean <br>
        - 0.023% by photosynthesis 

        <h3>Food Chains/Webs & Ecological Pyramids</h3>
        <u>Ecological Niche</u> - how every species interacts with others and in its ecosystem, (what it eats, what eats it, how it behaves) ROLE in the ecosystem <br> 
        <u>Food Chains</u> - oversimplified, who eats who <br>
        <u>Ecological Pyramids</u> - energy/biomass/numbers <br>
          INSERT IMAGE HERE

        <h3>Influence on Ecosysyem</h3>
        - <u>Tolerance range</u> - range of abiotic factors a species can survive it <br>
        - <u>Optimum range</u> - range where the conditions are perfect for species <br><br>
        - <u>COMPETITION</u> - 2 individuals go for same resource <br>
        - <u>PREDATION</u> - one individual feeds on another <br>
        - <u>MUTUALISM</u> - 2 individuals benefit each other<br>
        - <u>PARASITISM</u> - one individual lives in or on & feeds on host organism <br>
        - <u>COMMENSALISM</u> - 1 benfits the other is unaffected <br><br>
        - <u>Carrying capacity</u> - max population size for ecosystem<br> 

        <h4>Primary Succession</h4>
        - begins in lifeless areas<br>
        <h4>Secondary Sucession</h4>
        - occurs in an area that was previously inhabited but experienced disturbance (e.g. wildfire) <br>

        <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
        - Boosts ecosystem productivity <br>
        - Greater diversity = natural sustainability <br>
        - Makes ecosystem healthy <br>
        - Ecosystems withstand & recover from disasters more easily

        <h3>Species at Risk</h3>
        - <u>Special Concern</u> - species may become threatened or endangered (sea otter, giant pandas) <br>
        - <u>Threatened</u> - Likely to become endanagered if current trends continue<br>
        - <u>Endangered</u> - In danger of becoming extirpated or extinct (blue whale) <br>
        - <u>Extirpated</u> - Species no longer exists in the wild but still lives elsewhere (gray wolf) <br>
        - <u>Extinct</u> - Species has completely died out (tyrannosaurus rex) <br><br>

        <u>Fragmentation</u> - Division of a region, reduces sustainability of natural ecosystems (e.g., roads) <br>

        <h3>Acid Rain</h3>
        Sulfur dioxide & nitrogen oxides (produced in industrial processes, burning fossil fuels, vehicle exhaust) combine with water vapour in the atmosphere. <br>
        These air pollutions make water vapour very acidic. <br>
        1) SULFURIC ACID <mark>SO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O -> H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></mark><br>
        2) NITRIC ACID <mark>NO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O -> HNO<sub>3</sub></mark><br>
        Effects: <br>
        - damage to vegetation <br>
        - depletion of soil nutrients <br>
        - corrosion <br>
        - health problems including humans, animals, plants & other organisms <br>
        - acid leaching<br>
        - acidification of lakes <br>
        - less phytoplankton <br>
        However: <br>
        - Certain minerals, such as limestone are able to neutralize acid so limestone deposits near lakes tends to neutralize acid rain <br>
        - Much of Canada's precipitation comes off the US <br>
        - All cars are now fitted with catalytic convertors to help convert the pollutant gasses into less harmful ones <br>
        - Petrol companies have also produced low-sulfur petrol to help decrease the amount of sulfur dioxide produced <br>

        <h3>Oil Spills</h3>
        Methods of capturing/breaking down/dispersing oil: <br>
        1) <u>Skimming/vacuuming</u><br>
        - Floating oil may be contained & skimmed or vacuumed up into a recovery vessel <br>
        2) <u>Bioremediation</u><br>
        - Some microorganisms are capable of feeding on oil. This method uses bacteria to consume and break down pollutants <br>
        3) <u>Burning</u><br>
        - Oil floating on the surface is lit on fire so that it burns away <br>
        4) <u>Dispersal Agents</u><br>
        - Oil may be broken up into small droplets using detergents. This allows the droplets to be more easily washed out to sea & dispersed <br><br>

        <u>Plastic</u> - causes significant damage to marine ecosystems and pollution <br>
